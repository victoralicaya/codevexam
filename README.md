I am using XAMPP during development.

Here are the instructions on how to setup the project.
- Clone the project.
- CD to the project.
- Run the command `composer install`.
- Once done, setup ENV file and configure database connection.
- Run `php artisan key:generate` for APP_KEY.
- Run `php artisan migrate` for database migration.
- Run `npm install`.
- Once `npm install` is done, run `npm run dev`.
- Open your browser and type in the URL box the host to view the UI of the project.
